# OkHttp API Plugin for Jenkins

This plugin manages okhttp library version for Jenkins plugins.

This plugin includes the following packages:

* `com.squareup.okio:okio` - required by `okhttp`
* `com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp`
* `com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor` - commonly used by a number of plugins

Other `com.squareup.okhttp3.*` packages may be added upon request. 

This plugin **does not** include the following packages:

* `com.squareup.okhttp:*` (all v2.x okhttp packages) - 
  The last release in this line was v2.7.5 (2016-02-25).  
  It is not longer supported in any way. 
  Including them would only increase the risk of this plugin introducing security vulnerabilities and bugs.
  Plugins that want to use this plugin should update to use `okhttp3`. 
* `com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp-urlconnection` - 
  This package contained the `OkHttpUrlFactory` class which provides a facade implementing 
  link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html[HttpURLConnection] for okhttp.
  `OkHttpUrlFactory` was deprecated in 
  link:https://square.github.io/okhttp/changelog_3x/#version-300-rc1[v3.0.0-RC1 (2016-01-02)]
  and was removed as of
  link:https://square.github.io/okhttp/changelog_3x/#version-3140[v3.14.x (2019-03-14)] 
  so there is no reason to include this package.
  Plugins that use `OkHttpUrlFactory` and want to use this plugin are strongly advised to upgrade to OkHttp's request/response API directly.
  If that is not feasible, they can copy and paste 
  link:https://github.com/hub4j/github-api/blob/b33e9345562d7e58d0238902df6a0ba9f0fb7a69/src/main/java/org/kohsuke/github/extras/okhttp3/ObsoleteUrlFactory.java[ObsoleteUrlFactory.java] into their project.

## Migration from `async-http-client` tips

### Use the okhttp-api utility classes

`JenkinsOKHttpClient`

Use this class to instantiate an `OkHttpClient.Builder` that already has the Jenkins proxy configuration pre-set. It does not update the configuration, so if you want to get any change on Jenkins proxy (if there was some since the client was firstly instantiated) reflected in your client then you need to call `newClientBuilder` again passing the existing client.

As noted in the link:https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-ok-http-client/#customize-your-client-with-newbuilder[documentation], new clients coming from the builder share most of the resources, so there is no need to keep the same client as a singleton (normally).

Replace `RequestBuilder` with `OkHttpClient.Builder`.
Replace `Realm` with `Authenticator`:

```
public RequestBuilder authenticate(RequestBuilder builder) {
    return builder.setRealm(realm);
}
```

Becomes:

```
public OkHttpClient.Builder authenticate(OkHttpClient.Builder builder) {
    return builder.authenticator(authScheme);
}
```

### Adapter to Java Future API

Most of the usages of the AHC library are tied to the Java Future API, so it’s very convenient to keep the interfaces untouched while changing the implementation. To do this the okhttp-api plugin provides the `OkHttpFuture` class, which is an adapter from the native okhttp async API to the Java Future API. So you can do something like this:

```
return new OkHttpFuture<T>(call, new ResponseConverter<T>() {
    @Override
    public T onResponse(Call call, Response response) throws IOException {
        // handle the response        
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Call call, IOException e) {
        // handle the failure
    }
);
```

## Plugins using this plugin

* github-api

## Updating to a newer version of okhttp

The current plan is to release a series of progressive updates along the okhttp 4.x release line until the plugin is up-to-date with current releases. 

This is project includes a few tests (using the github-api library) that sanity check that the okhttp version being included doesn't completely break existing behavior.  

The okhttp library in general is large enough that tests beyond sanity checks would have limited usefulness.
link:https://square.github.io/okhttp/upgrading_to_okhttp_4/[With a few small exceptions], 
OkHttp 4.x is both binary- and Java source-compatible with OkHttp 3.x.
The okhttp team has worked very hard to not introduce breaking changes.
Still, be sure to carefully review the okhttp release notes before updating to a newer version okhttp. 

## Plugins bundling okhttp

Below are the list of other plugins that bundle on okhttp in various ways rather than using `okhttp-api-plugin`.  
The plugins are grouped based which version and packages they bundle.

### okhttp 4.x

*low risk*

The `okhttp-api-plugin` has updated to the 4.x release line.
This means updating these plugins to use `okhttp-api-plugin` has very low risk. 

```
defensics: okhttp-4.6.0.jar
octoperf: okhttp-4.3.0.jar
teamscale-upload: okhttp-4.2.1.jar
tuleap-api: okhttp-4.4.1.jar
tuleap-git-branch-source: okhttp-4.5.0.jar
worktile: okhttp-4.5.0.jar
```

### okhttp 3.x

*Low risk* 

okhttp 3.x (aka okhttp3 v3.x) has strong api stability across its lifetime. 
Most 3.x APIs remain unchanged in 4.x.

### okhttp-urlconnection 3.x

*Code changes required*

Support for `okhttp-urlconnection` was dropped in 3.14.x and later.
It only valid in 3.12.x and earlier. 

Plugins that use `OkHttpUrlFactory` are strongly advised to upgrade to OkHttp's request/response API directly.
If that is not feasible, they can copy and paste 
link:https://github.com/hub4j/github-api/blob/b33e9345562d7e58d0238902df6a0ba9f0fb7a69/src/main/java/org/kohsuke/github/extras/okhttp3/ObsoleteUrlFactory.java[ObsoleteUrlFactory.java] into their project.

### okhttp 2.x

*Code changes required*

This plugin does not include okhttp v2.x. 
This was done intentionally to avoid potential security issues related to bundling a version that is no longer maintained in any way.

The plugins below could be updated to use okhttp-api-plugin if they upgrade to using okhttp3.

There is some risk of this plugin affecting the plugins below - both `okhttp` and `okhttp3` depend on `okio`.  However, `okio` is also extremely stable and is unlikely to introduce breaking changes.
